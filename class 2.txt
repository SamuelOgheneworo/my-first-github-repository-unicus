HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements

HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

basic HTML practices

<!DOCTYPE html> - declares that the document is html5
<html> - Root html
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph

Nested Element
HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).

All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>)

Example
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>

Empty HTML Elements
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.

The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:

Example
<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>
